## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project I had some more practice on flex box and css grid, as well as have a try at a mobile-first workflow.
I learned how to make a tooltip arrow using css, practiced media-queries, reponsiveness and accessibility. 

### Continued development

I will continue to exercise on the aspects that I used in this project and one of my objectives for now is to get more practice in JavaScript, as well as transitions and animations.
