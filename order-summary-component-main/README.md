## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to pay more attention to detail and I understood more about flexbox and the way it works. I am overall very happy with the way it looks considering it is my first challenge :D

### Continued development

I am looking forward to keep learning on flexbox, positioning and media queries.
